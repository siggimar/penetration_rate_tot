# penetration_rate_tot
Code and data to analyze and present the effect of varying the rate of penetration of a Norwegian total sounding

The source data was collected in 2 sessions at two different sites in Norway, Ã˜ysand near Trondheim, and Kjellstad near Drammen.

The goal was to estimate if the penetration rates had a significant effect on the registered push resistance in the norwegian total sounding.
The main reason being that most descriptions of interpretation all assume that the drill-rig is able to maintain the standard rate, but experience
shows that this is not always the case.

A connection between the rate of penetration and the measured push resistance was found and a model was created to correct for this effect.
